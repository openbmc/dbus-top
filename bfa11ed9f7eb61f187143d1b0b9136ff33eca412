Generally `std::ignore` is used for tie or return values which are unused.\n\nTypically we either see the name removed (ie. delete the \u0027m\u0027) or `[[maybe_unused]]` added.\n\nSince you are the maintainer here, you\u0027re welcome to do what you prefer, but I think this pattern would not be natural to most contributors coming from other areas of the codebase.",
