      "message": "Oh..! Thanks for your advice on using `git subtree split`, this is actually my first time using it.\n\nI tested around on my local repositories and was able to push all the change in openbmc-tools/dbus-top to the new repo. Pushing that to Gerrit as-is would result in 5 changes. Is that the desired way to do it, or something else such as squashing all changes into one?",
